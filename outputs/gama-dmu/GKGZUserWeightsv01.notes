This table provides user-weighting for each unique classifier contributing
to the GAMA-KiDS Galaxy Zoo project. Following Willett et al. (2013), each
user is assigned a weight according to their consistency with other
classifiers. Usernames have been anonymised, here replaced with the user_id
column. Negative user IDs correspond to users who were not logged in.
