This table provides binned GAMA-KiDS Galaxy Zoo classification results. To
construct this table, alpha (raw) level results are concatenated per-galaxy.
The retirement number for each galaxy was set at 40, i.e., each galaxy aims
for at least 40 distinct classifiers. The _total columns show the total
number of classifiers answering a question; _frac shows the answer fraction.
