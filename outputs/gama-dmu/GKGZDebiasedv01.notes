This table provides debiased GAMA-KiDS Galaxy Zoo classification results.
Following Hart et al. (2016), cleaned (user-weighted) vote fractions are
corrected for the effect of redshift bias (*_deb_* columns). Additionally,
the "prior sample" psamp flag shows the galaxies for which it makes sense to
ask a given question (p_prior >= 0.5 AND N >= 5).
