This table provides cleaned (user-weighted) GAMA-KiDS Galaxy Zoo
classification results. Following Willett et al. (2013), each user is
assigned a weight according to their consistency with other classifiers.
Accordingly, their classification results are weighted here in order to
reduce the influence of potentially unreliable classifiers.
