This table lists additional ancillary data taken from existing GAMA
catalogues which have been used during data reduction of the GAMA-KiDS
Galaxy Zoo dataset. GAMA data in this table are derived from TilingCatv46,
DistancesFramesv14 and GroupFindingv08. GAMA CATAIDs have been matched to
Zooniverse IDs and galaxy zoo classification IDs, for reference.
